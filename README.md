# ai_flow_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Run code generation
We're using [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable/example) which generates boilerplate code to encode and decode models to json. 

To generate this code, run:
```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

## Generate icons
Icons for publishing are generated by [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons). The icon file is in `assets/icon`. 

To generate new icon, replace the `icon.png` file and run:
```
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```
